user_description: Front-end Specialization Course fresh grad with experience building responsive websites and specializing in HTML5, SCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with project experience working with Vue.js and Nuxt.js. I am a Junior Front-End Developer with 1 year experience of building eye-catching responsive websites.
  I really enjoy working both independently and within a team to deliver a quality product. Moreover, I keen on minimalistic and
  elegant design solutions for users - it satisfies me to see that there is a room for all elements on the website, and they're not crowded.
  I am currently actively using React in my pet projects.
